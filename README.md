# üéµ SoundChat - Your Musical Companion üéµ

Welcome to **SoundChat**! Transform your emotions into music with this AI-based intelligent playlist generator. Whether you're feeling joyful, melancholic, or in need of motivation, SoundChat creates personalized playlists that match your mood. Let's dive into the world of music and emotions!

A deployed version of SoundChat is available at [bit.ly/soundchatai](https://bit.ly/soundchatai).
To use this application, you'll need to be added as a user on the Spotify Developer Dashboard. This is because I am currently using Spotify's development API, which has usage limits.

- **Spotify Integration**: Connect your Spotify account and enjoy your custom playlists directly.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for a seamless experience.
